            The Machine-Learning model in the Jijue platform has been designed using credible data. Different
            variables have been used in the model to compute the risk of an individual turning HIV positive. However the   
            risk score calculated by our website is not final hence it does not reflect your actual HIV status. One can    
            only ascertain his/her HIV status by getting tested from a VCT Centre or by using a self-test kit.
