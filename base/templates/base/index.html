                                Jijue is a platform where one assess their risk of contracting HIV
                                by undertaking a short assessment that involves a questionnaire on different
                                risk factors that may make one vulnerable to contracting the virus.
                                Questions asked are based on real statistics on how HIV is spread, sexual behaviors and even use of drug substance between individuals mostly by shared
                                Syringe injection which is a culminating factor in spread of HIV.
                                After assessment, a risk score is auto-generated by our Machine Learning Model that shows your risk level and recommends ways to minimize chances of contracting the virus.

                                        Did you know that HIV came from chimps as far back as the 19th century? 
                                        Human hunters were the bridge to this, as they would eat the meat or come into 
                                        contact with the blood of monkeys and apes.
                                        HIV, fully known as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus is a virus that weakens the bodyâ€™s ability to fight off infections. 
                                        A non-curable but controllable disease. 
                                        Therefore a person infected with HIV has a resultant weak immunity and if not treated will lead to AIDS- Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome- the most severe phase of
                                         HIV infection.

                                    <p>
                                        The only way HIV is transmitted is through contact with body fluids- Blood, Semen, Vaginal fluids, Breast milk, that come from someone living with HIV fluids.
                                        These fluids have the highest concentration of the HIV virus.
                                        Therefore, having (anal, vaginal, oral )sex with a person living with HIV WITHOUT use of a condom, sharing of drug and tattoo needles with someone living with HIV and mother-to-child during birth and breast feeding are important ways of acquiring HIV.

                                        HIV is somewhat of a silent and non specific disease in its early stages and symptoms only come about in advanced stages. 
                                        At first, flu- like symptoms may show within 2-6 weeks after infection;fever, sorethroat, body rash, but thereafter may take several years for any other symptoms to show.
